# OralHistoryGenerator
A project for NaNoGenMo to create a fictional book-length oral history using an LLM

This project is being produced as part of [NaNoGenMo 2024](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2024). As part of this I have kept a [daily diary](DIARY.md)

## Usage notes
This is a commandline Spring AI. Building and running this requires a JDK.

```mvn clean package``` will produce a Jar file containing the code.

This can then be executed with ```java -jar target/oral-history-generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```
