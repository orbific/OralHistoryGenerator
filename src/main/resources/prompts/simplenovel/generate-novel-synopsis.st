The Great Gatsby 2: Gatsby vs Kong is a tragic novel about a rich man who devotes his life to fighting kaiju.
It is set in 1980s New York, at the height of the yuppie era.

The style is similar to that of Fitzgerald.

I want to produce a list of {chapterCount} chapter titles, with a single sentence description of each.
The chapters will tell the story of Jay Gatsby, his amazing parties, and the fearsome kaiju that threatened the city he loved.
For each chapter I want a detailed description, featuring key events that happen and the mood of this section.
This description will be several sentences long.

Over the {chapterCount} chapters, a strange version of Gatsby's story is told.

There should also be a summary of the book, which is a detailed paragraph explaining the general arc.

The book will feature references to actual events and popular figures of the 1980s.
