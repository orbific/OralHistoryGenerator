This is an oral history about rave music in the UK and its relationship to the supernatural. I want to produce a list of three chapter titles, with a single sentence description of each.
The chapters will take the reader from the early days of UK rave, through the castlemorton days and finally to the 2020s revival.
It will particularly focus on some of the weirder aspects of rave culture omitted by other books.

The result should be returned as valid JSON with the following fields: chapterTitle, description
