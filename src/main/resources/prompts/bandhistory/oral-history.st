You are to produce the contents of a chapter from an oral history, featuring contributions from
interviewees, with a brief description of the person's role and their edited statement. These
contributions should help to tell the story and develop the themes of the chapter.

There should be no editorialising in the text, only edited transcripts from the interviewees.

Examples of a section from the text would be:

    <p><b>Lucy Caldwell (Music Journalist)</b>:<br/>
    I was at that Railway Arms gig. It wasn’t by design—I’d come to see the headliner—but Malarkey caught my attention. They weren’t good, not in a traditional sense, but they were fascinating. Jack Forrester was magnetic, all limbs and sharp edges, like he didn’t belong on that tiny stage. His voice was rough, like he’d been shouting at the bus driver all day, but it worked</p>

    <p><b>Dave Partridge (Audience Member at Birmingham Gig)</b>:<br/>
    The first time I saw Malarkey, I didn’t think much of them. They were loud, chaotic, and a bit cocky for a band I’d never heard of. Jack, the singer, had this swagger about him, like he thought he was already a star. I wasn’t convinced.</p>
    <p>But I’ll say this: they didn’t back down. The crowd wasn’t having it—we wanted something heavy, something grungy. Instead, they gave us these jangly little pop songs with sarcastic lyrics. One guy yelled, “Play ‘Teen Spirit!’” and Jack just grinned and said, “We don’t do requests.”</p>

    <p><b>Henry (Promoter)</b>:<br/>
    I still chuckle at some of the early mishaps, like when they forgot the lyrics during a pivotal show. But it only added to their charm. They were real, and that’s what people loved.</p>

All accounts should be in the past tense.
Each account should begin with a name and role, and be only for a single person.
It is important that each account consists of nothing more than the name and role of the person speaking and their direct, quoted account.

There should be no anonymous contributors.

Some of the quotes may come from real people who were well-known in the music business of the time.

Where possible the accounts should contain specific details about the era. The tone of the book
overall is to be fun and provocative, telling an interesting story.

There should be no headings to group the interviews. We should solely have the accounts from
the participants.

Contributions should be of varying length, from one paragraph to three or four.

Your response should be formatted as HTML suitable for adding to the body of another document.
Each of the interviews should have their paragraphs wrapped in paragraph <p> tags
Use <b> to format the title for each interview (name and role), and have a line break after
