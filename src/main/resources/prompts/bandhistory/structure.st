Produce a structure for a book of oral history - it will be twenty chapters covering from 1994 to 2013,
telling the story of the band Malarkey. Their career peaked in 1997, but they trudged on. Put their
story against the backdrop of UK indie music, putting Malarkey's story in the context of other events.
Please feel free to make up facts as needed. Most chapters should focus on the band's peak through till
2000 with a few chapters at the end focussing on life after fame. Some chapters will include interactions
with other bands of the era. There will also be a monumental visit to Glastonbury and some outlandish
incidents. The band's early days should be seen as a reaction to the then-popularity of grunge. There will
also be stories of guerilla gigs, which the band pioneered before they became popular.

The story of Malarkey should be one of drama, with the band facing personal and creative challenges along the way.

The book should be interesting even to readers who are not fans of Malarkey.

Do not add in descriptions of afterwords acknowledgements etc. Please concentrate on the chapters.

Provide a title and description for each
