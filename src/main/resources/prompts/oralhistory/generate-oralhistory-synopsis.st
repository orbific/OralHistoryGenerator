This is an oral history about rave music in the UK and its relationship to the supernatural.

I want to produce a list of {chapterCount} chapter titles, with a single sentence description of each.
The chapters will take the reader from the early days of UK rave, through the significant historical events, up to the current day.
It will particularly focus on some of the weirder aspects of rave culture omitted by other books.

Each chapter should cover a distinct historical era or a particular theme/subgenre.

Specific attention should be paid to important historical events.

There should also be a summary of the book, which is a detailed paragraph explaining the general arc.
