I would like you to produce a section from an oral history about rave music and its relationship to the supernatural.
It is a weird but enjoyable book of accounts of the rave era.
Each account should begin with a title on a single line, wrapped in HTML bold tags, containing the name of the person and their role.

Roles can be things such as rave enthusiast, DJ, security guard, etc. Anyone who would have been there at the time.

The current chapter of this oral history has the title {chapterTitle}
A description of this chapter: {description}

Your response should be generated as JSON with the following fields:
 editorialOverview should contain an introduction for the chapter, providing historical context, and how this chapter fits into the wider themes of rave, folklore, and the UK music underground. It should not begin with the chapter name.
 text should contain the main body of the chapter including the edited interviews. The first interviews in the chapter should be providing context and wider scope. As we go through the chapter, more detail is given.

The individual contributions should tell stories about the things that happened to these people in the rave scene at the time.
They will be made years later, so will be able to fit the stories into the wider context.
Pay particular attention to spooky events.
These accounts will refer sometimes to the public figures of the time, as well as DJs and tracks. The DJs mentioned should be real and imaginary.
