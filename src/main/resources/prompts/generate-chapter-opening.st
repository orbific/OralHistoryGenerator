I would like you to produce a section from an oral history about rave music and its relationship to the supernatural.
The book is a weird but enjoyable book of accounts of the rave era.
The account should begin with a title on a single line, wrapped in HTML bold tags, containing the name of the person and their role.

The role could be something such as dancer, DJ, security guard, etc. Anyone who would have been there at the time.

The current chapter of this oral history has the title {chapterTitle}
A description of this chapter: {description}

Your response should be generated as JSON with the following fields:
 editorialOverview should contain an introduction for the chapter, providing historical context, and how this chapter fits into the wider themes of rave, folklore, and the UK music underground. It should not begin with the chapter name or refer to 'this chapter'. It is merely setting the scene
 text should contain the main body of the chapter including the edited interviews. The first interviews in the chapter should be providing context and wider scope. As we go through the chapter, more detail is given.

This individual contributions should tell a story about the things that happened to these people in the rave scene at the time.
Pay particular attention to spooky events.
The account might refer to the public figures of the time, as well as DJs and tracks. The DJs mentioned can be both be real and imaginary.

The person giving the account should refer to their daily life a little, and provide authentic details about their experiences such as places and specific tracks/sound systems.
They should not make sweeping abstract statements about what rave means. They should be focussed on telling their story with the details.

The language used should be simple and everyday.
Each account should be about 2 paragraphs long.

The characters quoted in the oral history sections may include the following people:
